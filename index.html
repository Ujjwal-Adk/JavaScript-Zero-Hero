          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Ujjwal Adhikari</strong> üëã ‚Äî a tech enthusiast,
            beginner developer, and creative learner who loves building websites
            and exploring the world of coding. My journey into tech started back
            in high school when I took <em>IP as an optional subject</em>, and
            since then I‚Äôve been fascinated by how websites and digital tools
            are built.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I‚Äôve explored different areas of technology, from
            <strong>circuit design and robotics</strong> (where I won first
            place in the <em>COAS Grand Science Exhibition 2023</em>) to
            <strong>web development and design</strong>, which combines my
            passion for coding and creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I‚Äôm working on improving my
            <strong>web development skills</strong> while also exploring
            opportunities in Canada. My goal is to design digital experiences
            that are <em>functional, beautiful, and fun to use</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy fitness, art, and learning new things
            that keep me curious and motivated. I believe technology is not just
            about solving problems, but also about making life more creative and
            meaningful.
          </p>
