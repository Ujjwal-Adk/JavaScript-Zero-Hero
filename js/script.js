// So now This is Day 2 and lets learn about the variables today 
// there are three ways to declare the variables i.e let , var , const 
// best practice to declare any variables is using let alwasys 

const myName  = "Ujjwal Adhikari"; // String 
const myAge = 20; // int 

let currentYear = 2025; //int
let isLearning = true; //Boolean

// Now as we learned declaring variables we will print that in console 

console.log(myName)
console.log("I am" + myAge + "years old");
console.log("current Year :" + currentYear)
